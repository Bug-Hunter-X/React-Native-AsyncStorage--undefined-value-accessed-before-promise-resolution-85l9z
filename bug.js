This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in React Native and you try to access the stored data before it has been fully retrieved.  The `getItem` method is asynchronous, meaning it doesn't return the value immediately.  If you try to use the result before the promise resolves, you'll get `undefined`.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage
AsyncStorage.getItem('myKey').then(value => {
  console.log(value); //This might log undefined if it's not ready
  this.setState({ myData: value });
});

console.log(this.state.myData); //Always undefined here
```
